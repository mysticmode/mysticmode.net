        <p>
          Many generations come and go and as an individual you most likely have
          few people in the past to admire and learn from them and try to
          incorporate the working some of those characteristics for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          And for me, Bruce Lee is one such person. I'll try to explain how and
          why his life had impacted me on my professional carrier and more so
          with my personal life. More importantly, I'm going to convey this in
          my own style without formally reading his books or books written by
          others about him.
        </p>
        <p>
          We all know that Bruce Lee is not just an extraordinary martial artist
          but also a deep thinker. So, that much I know from watching videos
          about him and some resources and his quotations that I learned from
          the Internet. Hence, I'm going to give a brief of what my perspectives
          about him are.

          Bruce Lee's simple philosophy of living is his explanation of "Be
          Water" portrayed in his The "Lost" Interview in Pierre Berton show.
          There is a catch in that which is very important where he says "be
          formless and shapeless". It means that if you are too rigid on
          yourself; you cannot grow and mature in your life. It can be seen in
          his fighting style that were changed and adopted during different
          phases of his life and coming up with his own martial artform called
          Jeet Kune Do.
        </p>
        <p>
          It doesn't end there; he also puts one more important point in that
          interview which is the yin-yang philosophy. He portrays that as - "You
          cannot be too natural or too unnatural, the ideal solution is natural
          unnaturalness or unnatural naturalness".
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what they say in Buddhism, walking the middle path or to put
          in other terms, the way of life is to change what you can, but never
          lose to go with the flow as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of those many thoughts of Bruce Lee that was said by his close
          knits and his students is he wants you to live by your own goals with
          your own principles and not just being a mere follower of somebody or
          himself, but expressing yourself honestly to others and to the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many players in this world, who inspire by talk. But the man
          in the arena guy for me is Bruce Lee. Because his very living in this
          world is an example that one can succeed with hard work, determination
          and deep focus.
